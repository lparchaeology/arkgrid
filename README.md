# ARK Grid

*ARK Grid* is a QGIS Plugin to create and work with local site grids as commonly used in archaeology.

A grid wizard allows you to create grids from two known points, or from a known origin and baseline. Interactive tools are provided to convert between local coordinates and map coordinates.

*ARK Grid* is developed as part of ARK, the [Archaeological Recording Kit](http://ark.lparchaeology.com), by [L ~ P : Archaeology](http://www.lparchaeology.com).
